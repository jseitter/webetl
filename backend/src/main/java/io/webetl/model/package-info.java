/**
 * Core model classes for WebETL.
 * 
 * This package contains the fundamental data structures used in WebETL:
 * 
 * - design/: Components and their visual representation for flow design
 * - runtime/: Runtime execution components with queue-based data processing
 * - data/: Data structures like Row/Parameter for representing the actual data being processed
 * 
 * The model separates design-time concerns (visual flow composition) from 
 * runtime concerns (data processing and orchestration).
